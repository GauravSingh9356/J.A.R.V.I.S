Small changes here from the original code created and maintained by [GauravSingh9356](https://github.com/GauravSingh9356/J.A.R.V.I.S). The idea here is get a more friendly code and human-machine interface, and as faithful as possible to the original electronic smart assistant.

This system is **under construction**. The official development and testing environment is Windows, using Microsoft Visual Studio with Python support as IDE ([this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D8TXQkO948) can help you set the environment). Its compatibilty with other platforms is not ready yet, but contributions are welcome.

### Requirements:

<h2>Required Packages</h2>

```
pip3 install SpeechRecognition
pip3 install jsonlib
pip3 install pyttsx3
pip3 install PyAudio
pip3 install geocoder
pip3 install loc

```


### On Ubuntu based Linux distribution you need to install the following packages, so that the code to work:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc make perl python3-pip espeak

```

### If you have problems with libs above you can try the respective packages found under VS and Ubuntu:
```
jsonlib (jsonlib-python3)
PyAudio (python3-pyaudio)
```

### Language support:
Voice synthetizing is done by pyttsx3 module. It gets Operating System language configurations. Some [help with language settings can be found here](https://medium.com/better-programming/an-introduction-to-pyttsx3-a-text-to-speech-converter-for-python-4a7e1ce825c3) .

## What it does...

</ul>

### Future Plans

For now there are some [tasks disposed in project Mark I](https://github.com/dbeniciorj/J.A.R.V.I.S/projects/1) and anybody can help, just assign yourself and move it to IN PROGRESS column. Changes would be merged by me asap.

<h1>Sky is limit. There are immense possibilities in this project. Will be integrating some other very powerful commands soon..</h1>
